this file have the info of what i have learned all this time
git is the distributed version control system where user can have local repo and centralised repo for all the collabarators 
There are two ways to start the git in our local machine one is git clone repo https link or create a folder and do git in it and then git remote add location https link of repo
the default branch in local and remote is master and we can change the name of it as well 
Branches are created usually to maintain one stable code in one branch and can do analysis or development in another branches. suppose if we only have once branh and our new code is not working properly that leads our application to stop working and that is not suggestable so to avoid that we will create multiple branches and maintain our working code or stable code in master or main branch
If the new features are working fine and testing is done then only we push that code into main branch
Readme.md file is used to describe the repo and its features
To add files into local branch > git add . or git add -A or git add file name 
then that file will come to index location 
we need to commit for every change > git commit -m "message related to that change" 
Every commit tells us what is the change and when it is done and who made that change and in which branch it is done
To check commits > git log
To check whether files are staged or tracked meaning whether files are added into local repo or not use git status
"git status" gives us files staging info
"git log" gives us commits info
"git commit" tell us what is the change 
To create the branch for our new developments and to avoid discontinuty of our app, "git branch branch name" or "git checkout -b branch name"
"git branch" gives you total branches names and in which branch you are right now with specific colout
"git branch branchname" creates a new branch
"git checkout -b branch name" will checkout from existing branch and creates a new branch with mentioned name
"git rm filename" is used to remove the file
the standard procesdure to push the latest code is pull it first and then push it to the respective branch
Because so many  persons will work on the same project so every one will update that branch so to push changes we need to pull the latest code in remote branch and push it 
"git pull origin branch name" will pull the files from remote mentioned branch
"git push origin branch name" in this command branch name is remote branch name
to merge the branches first we need checkout to the destination branch 
git merge branch name eg "git branch dev/qa/stage"
To check the info of particular commit "git show commit id(first 7 letters of sha1 code)"
to compare between commits "git show HEAD~1" that shows difference between two commits
We can see who made changes to a file by using "git annotate filename"
or we can check it in remote by using blame option
To provide version numbers meaning to add tags , first we need to be one branch like master then do "git tag 1.0" 
to check use git tag then it shows what was the verision assigned before 
we can check it on remote as well under tags 
but before that we need to push that change by using "git push origin v 1.0"
we need to protect our master or main branch on order to avoid unauthorized push or pull 
For that we need to select settings, select branches and there are several rools. We need to select what ever applicable to our project
for freezing period, branch lock will be used
to provide access to the team, use manage access
